1. Implement final pieces of CRUD functionality
    [X] delete
    [X] update
2. This should be fairly simple, but requires adding ID properly to each event
3. Once this is finished, the logic for managing multiple pages, IE multiple days
   should be implemented
   Only a single date should display at once, so the overall render should be the Day.
   Requirements for this implementation are as follows
   [X] add currentDay to context
   [X] drop CalendarContainer down and wrap it in Day component
   //Original implementation was unnecessary, simply added a day column to each event, then grabbed events
     based on current day. May need to implement some aspects of original implementation when doing
     navigation but I don't think so. All I need to do is move the currentDay with the navigation and
     the render should update to include no events because no events are on the currentDay in database.
   [x] implement navigation to move between days
   [x] implement datepicker
        [X] resolve middlewares so they actually work as intended
            [X] massive pita
            [X] every action must pass date info
            [X] every update, add, or delete will call fetch afterwards
        [] transition from luxon to dayjs
        [] UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
    [X] Finish datepicker crap

//If you get bored once you finish 2 and need a break from other stuff

1. Figure out mapping events to hour display
    [X] events map properly to hour display on manual update and addition
    [] figure out how to map events dynamically on drag and resize, and how to update time dynamically
        [] figure out how to get size to update properly on completion of resize
        [] figure out how to send that information to backend
        [] figure out how to get position to update properly on completion of drag
        [] figure out how to dynamically update times according to resize
        [] figure out how to dynamically update times according to drag
//Sidequest

[] Reorganize context so there are less re-renders
    [] This is going to be the actual massive pita xdd
